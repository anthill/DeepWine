A place to explore various deep learning techniques using [ConvNetJS](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/index.html).

These examples were written in a simple way on order to be understable by all.
We used classic open datasets, and tested several approaches. The goal here was to train ourselves to the use of ConvNetJS library, not establish the best models possible.

## Wine

A regression, with or without PCA.

## Servo

A regression with embedded categorical features.

## Iris

## Titanic
